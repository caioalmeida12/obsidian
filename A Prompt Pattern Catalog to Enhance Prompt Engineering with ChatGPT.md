> **A prompt [9] is a set of instructions provided to an LLM that programs the LLM by customizing it and/or enhancing or refining its capabilities.** A prompt can influence subsequent interactions with—and output generated from—an LLM by providing specific rules and guidelines for an LLM conversation with a set of initial rules. In particular, a prompt sets the context for the conversation and tells the LLM what information is important and what the desired output form and content should be.

> **Prompt engineering is the means by which LLMs are programmed via prompts.** To demonstrate the power of prompt engineering, we provide the following prompt: Prompt: “From now on, I would like you to ask me questions to deploy a Python application to AWS. When you have enough information to deploy the application, create a Python script to automate the deployment.”

>Moreover, prompts can be engineered to program an LLM to accomplish much more than simply dictating the output type or filtering the information provided to the model. With the right prompt, it is possible to create entirely new interaction paradigms, such as having an LLM generate and give a quiz associated with a software engineering concept or tool, or even simulate a Linux terminal window. Moreover, prompts have the potential for self-adaptation, suggesting other prompts to gather additional information or generate related artifacts. **These advanced capabilities of prompts highlight the importance of engineering them to provide value beyond simple text or code generation.**


> [!NOTE] Title
> **Prompt patterns are essential to effective prompt engineering.** A key contribution of this paper is the introduction of prompt patterns to document successful approaches for systematically engineering different output and interaction goals when working with conversational LLMs. We focus largely on engineering domain-independent prompt patterns and introduce a catalog of essential prompt patterns to solve problems ranging from production of visualizations and code artifacts to automation of output steps that help fact check outputs.
